# Sweater Weather
## Responsive web design for when the weather gets cold

Welcome to the Sweater Weather project. A work in progress where the end goal is to allow users to create and interact with their very own sweater.

the current iteration is quite basic and does the following:
1. Uses a column of grids to create a responive layout of various colors and shapes
2. Uses a polygonal clip-path to hide the elements of the grid outside of a sweater shape
3. Uses various styling elements to create the experience of a not so cozy envirnoment.

The basics are laid out, but I'd like to clean up the following:
1. The outline of the sweater is quite atrocius. I'd like to rewrite the clip-path to fit within the border image, and I'd like to recolor the border image to fit the styling of the snowy background.
2. I'd like to create color palletes unique to each section of the sweater that would then complement the other sections to create a nicer overall design.
3. I'd like to adjust the grid-gaps coloring and sizing within the sweater to fit with the final color pallet.

Once those steps are achieved, I'd like to create a form that would allow a user to create their own design. This might include the following:
1. A preset group of color palletes to chose from
2. A range that would allow users to adjust the number of sections on their sweater
3. An input that wold allow the user to select from a few layouts for each individual section

Other features that might be nice:
1. Allow a user to upload a photo of their own sweater for comparison
2. Allow a user to change the background
3. Allow a user to embed or post their sweater to social media

### Stay cozy!

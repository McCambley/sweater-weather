# Sweater Weather
## Responsive web design for when the weather gets cold

Welcome to the Sweater Weather project. A work in progress where the end goal is to allow users to create and interact with their very own sweater.

the current iteration is quite basic and does the following:
1. Uses a column of grids to create a responive layout of various colors and shapes
2. Uses a polygonal clip-path to hide the elements of the grid outside of a sweater shape
3. Uses various styling elements to create the experience of a not so cozy envirnoment.

The basics are laid out, but I'd like to clean up the following:
1. First off I'd like the clean up the code... it's a mess in there
2. ~~I'd like to lay the ground work of grids and animations such that everything is in place, and only minor adjustments need to be made to account for styling. In a sense, this is my Minimum Viable Product~~
1. ~~The outline of the sweater is quite atrocius. I'd like to rewrite the clip-path to fit within the border image, and I'd like to recolor the border image to fit the styling of the snowy background.~~
2. I'd like to create color palletes unique to each section of the sweater that would then complement the other sections to create a nicer overall design.
3. I'd like to adjust the grid-gaps coloring and sizing within the sweater to fit with the final color pallet.
4. Once the final color pallettes are chosen, I'd like to fine tune the clip-paths and grid sizes of each section to fit a more cohesive design. Again, I'm going for "not so ugly sweater" here.

Once those steps are achieved, I'd like to create a form that would allow a user to create their own design. This might include the following:
1. A preset group of color palletes to chose from
2. A range that would allow users to adjust the number of sections on their sweater
3. An input that wold allow the user to select from a few layouts for each individual section

Other features that might be nice:
1. Allow a user to upload a photo of their own sweater for comparison
2. Allow a user to change the background
3. Allow a user to embed or post their sweater to social media

### Stay cozy!
